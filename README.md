# Streamlining Signaling Pathway Reconstruction

This repo is a work-in-progress dockerized library of pathway reconstruction enhancement tools. The framework will contain different graph algorithms that connect genes and proteins of interest in the context of a general protein-protein interaction network, allowing users to run multiple algorithms on their inputs.  This library is inspired by tools for single-cell transcriptomics such as [BEELINE](https://github.com/Murali-group/Beeline) and [dynverse](https://github.com/dynverse).

Right now, this repo contains all the pieces that are being integrated into a single framework.  This is very much a work in progress.
