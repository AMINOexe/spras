# Local Neighborhood Docker image

A simple pathway reconstruction algorithm used to welcome new contributors.
The algorithm takes a network and a list of nodes as input.
It outputs all edges in the network.

New contributors complete the `Dockerfile` to wrap the implementation in `local_neighborhood.py`.
